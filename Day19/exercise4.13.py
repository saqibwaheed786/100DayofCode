#4-13. Buffet: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five
#simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
#• Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
#• Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the
#change.
#• The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different
#foods. Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for
#loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

dinner_buffet =("Roast Beef","Chicken Piccata","Vegetable Primavera","Italian Lasagna")
print("Old Dinner Buffet List 2019:\n")
for items in dinner_buffet:
  print(items)
#dinner_buffet[0]= "burger

dinner_buffet =("Roast Beef","Chicken Piccata","Vegetable Primavera","Italian Lasagna", "Chicken Rost", "Mutton Rost")
print("\nNew Dinner Buffet List 2019:\n")
